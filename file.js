  /*
FlatList - provides item and index by default when you use renderItem
         - <FlatList> also expects a unique key for each item. You handle this with the keyExtractor prop.
  -item: the current item in the data array,
  -index: the index of that item  
  
.map(...) - loops through that list, rendering each category button. 
.map((item, index, array) - default in order pero pwedeng irename

SCROLLVIEW with .map() is better for small number of items but with large dynamic list FLATLIST is better.
  
renderItem - always receives an object like { item, index }
